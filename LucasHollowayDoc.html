        <p>The Ideal Digital Humanities Project</p>
        <p><br /> The pool of quality digital humanities projects is large and diverse to the point
            that finding common traits among all of them is challenging. This is especially true
            when factoring in non conventional projects. For example, one trait that is nearly
            universal among great digital humanities projects is ease of use. However, even for this
            there exists some outlier cases of digital humanities projects that remain great without
            being particularly user friendly. This comes into play when considering certain video
            games to be works of digital humanities. In these examples, the games can even be
            outwardly hostile toward the user. A game like Papers, Please for instance obfuscates
            information by way of overload. However, there are exceptions to everything. For this
            reason, rather than claim a static set of traits for an ideal digital humanities project
            I propose a pool of traits that are likely to lead to a successful digital humanities
            project.</p>
        <p>One nearly universal commonality among great digital humanities project is that they
            strike a comfortable balance between the human and the digital elements. A great digital
            humanities project does not put too much emphasis on the technology while downplaying
            the humanities. This goes both ways, but it is also an oversimplification. There
            shouldn&rsquo;t have to be a line drawn between the D and the H in digital humanities.
            Theory doesn&rsquo;t need to have exist separately from technology. In <em>Developing
                Things: Notes Toward an Epistemology of Building in the Digital Humanities</em>,
            Stephen Ramsay and Geoffrey Rockwell downplay the role that tools play as works of
            digital humanities, but that doesn&rsquo;t take into account the rhetorical decision
            making that goes into making these tools work. &ldquo;Such tools are celebrated for
            their transparency or as Heidegger puts it, for the way they stand-like hammers or
            pencils-ready to hand&hellip; Such tools don&rsquo;t explain or argue, but simply
            facilitate.&rdquo; Every choice in the design of a website reflects an argument
            implicitly. When planning a digitization of a soldier&rsquo;s journal, the choice to
            juxtapose historical images next to passages from a daily log changes how a user might
            interpret the text. <br /><br /> One thing an ideal digital humanities project should do
            is in some way expand the discourse on its subject matter. Thorough research needs to be
            done to ensure that the project presents new, relevant information or examines the
            material in a new way. This can be facilitated by digitizing and making a poet&rsquo;s
            manuscripts public, creating a platform for highlighting lesser known contemporary
            painters, or juxtaposing digital maps with the original text of someone&rsquo;s journey.
            For most institutionally sponsored digital humanities projects this is a requirement as
            the opportunity to bring new insight to a topic is a crucial part of getting funded.
            However, merely thinking about expanding the critical conversation as a means to achieve
            funding is insufficient and bound to fail in the long run. </p>
        <p>The team behind the project needs members with passion for the material. People who care
            deeply about the subject matter are going to work hard to make the project happen. Most
            of the time, people who care the most about a subject are people who have relevant
            perspectives on it. For instance, in the case of a digital humanities project focusing
            on recovery of LBGTQ filmmakers during the twentieth century, it would demand a team
            comprised of individuals who come from an LBGTQ background of varying race, gender, and
            orientation. This diversity should extend to all the roles involved in project
            development from project managers to coders and researchers. As it stands in the tech
            world, representation is lopsided with the majority being heterosexual white male.
            Digital humanities has an opportunity and obligation to include new kinds of voices in
            the field and any ideal DH project should make good on that. </p>
        <p>However, assembling the team is just the first step. There needs to be collaboration, and
            for collaboration to be successful there needs to be a person or group of people who can
            provide mediation between the specialized members of the team. Someone whose area of
            expertise comes from an academic non-technical background might have difficulty
            communicating with someone working on the back end software of a project. Any changes
            that occur during development This allows the two experts to continue doing what they do
            best without needing to struggle with breakdowns in understanding. Quality communication
            and collaboration also enables the ability to quickly shift project goals. For example,
            if someone new joins the project and excites some of the researchers with an interesting
            way of displaying a manuscript, the leaders of the team can work with the designers to
            determine the feasibility of the method and if it would be compatible with the current
            resources. Once determined, the programmers can begin to execute a plan incorporating
            the manuscript presentation that fits with the current infrastructure of the website. </p>
        <p><br /> The ideal digital humanities project should be built with a community in mind. The
            design of the website could emphasize scholarly research or it could be made with
            Because of the openness of the internet people from all walks of life could potentially
            be a part of that community. With this in mind, emphasis should be placed on the user
            friendliness of the design. If people find it inconvenient to navigate the website then
            the project risks alienating them. When trying to reach out to the largest number of
            users possible, this extends to differently abled users as well. To strive toward the
            ideal digital humanities project principles of universal design should be implemented to
            facilitate this. To embrace universal design, highlighted in George H. Williams essay
                <em>Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities, </em>is to
            &ldquo;approach every problem ...with the ultimate goal of providing the greatest
            benefit to the greatest number of people possible&rdquo; which in this case means trying
            to build the most useable interface for as many people as possible.<br /> Occasionally,
            exciting new technology comes about that opens up possibilities for presenting,
            exploring, or building the project. However, it is prudent to avoid needlessly
            complicating a website even if a new video technology might be appealing. Sometimes
            though, complexity cannot be avoided as the nature of the tools prevents any further
            simplification. In cases like these a tutorial could be made to walk users through the
            process of navigating the site&rsquo;s tools. Other times, a hard choice needs to be
            made about cutting a feature for the sake of the user experience. What can make this
            even more difficult is when a promised feature simply never lives up to its intended
            purpose or causes massive slowdowns in the project&rsquo;s performance. This happens a
            lot with large digital projects that deal with deadlines, especially within game design. </p>
        <p>Sustainability is another hurdle to be overcome by any digital humanities project ideal
            or no. Once the money for the project has run out how will happen to it? Projects will
            have issues with compatibility in browsers, playing video, implementing plugins and
            countless others over time. A good project will have a plan laid out to handle these
            issues as they are inevitably encountered over time. In the case of some sort of unseen
            catastrophic event happening to the project, there needs to be a backup of the essential
            data so that it can be potential revitalized or at least preserve the most important
            digital artifacts. </p>
        <p>The ideal digital humanities project is one that marries the digital and human elements
            and incorporates a mixture of diversity, community, and collaboration to expand the
            critical discourse on the particular subject matter that it pertains to. </p>
